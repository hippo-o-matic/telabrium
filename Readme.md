# Telabrium
Telabrium is yet another object based OpenGL game engine library.

#### Notice:
The engine in its current form is primarily a hobby project and shouldn't be used for really anything. Entire components or even the overall design of this project are subject to change.

Currently the engine can:
- Load most models through assimp
- Create, save, and load input binds through an external json file
- Light and shade a scene using OpenGL and GLSL shaders
- Organize it's objects in a hierarchical structure
- Look I'm stretching here but learning C++ ~~is~~ was hard

Documentation will be made available once the project is near a usable state

#### Project Goals
Telabrium will ideally become a platform for other code, providing a bit of commonality for basic things (models, rendering, level loading) and support for powerful C++ extensions that will provide modularity, and ideally, lightweightness to the final product.

#### Why the heck are you making this public now if it's not finished yet?
This project, from start to present, has been a learning experience. When I started I didn't even know how to compile a simple C++ program. It was just me, [learnopengl.com](http://learnopengl.com "learnopengl.com") (thank you JoeyDeVries) and a vauge idea of what I wanted to do. Two years later, I don't just have a product that actually has some potential to go somewhere, I have knowledge of how to use build systems, what version control is and how to use it,  what people consider good and bad practice, what those awful template errors mean, and most importantly, how to plan for something this big in the future. Making a game engine from scratch without knowing basically anything is a bad idea, but I don't regret doing it. 

In summary: It's public so I can put it on my resume.

Now that I actually know what I'm doing, development will hopefully accelerate(TM).
