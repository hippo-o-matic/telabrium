# Telabrium
Telabrium is yet another object based OpenGL game engine library.

#### Notice:
The engine in its current form is primarily a hobby project and shouldn't be used for really anything. Entire components or even the overall design of this project are subject to change.

Currently the engine can:
- Load most models through assimp
- Create, save, and load input binds through an external json file
- Organize objects in a hierarchical system that allows them to inherit their parents spatial transformations
- Load multiple objects from a file
- Light and shade a scene using OpenGL and GLSL shaders
- Render meshes using multiple different customizable materials

Documentation will be made available once the project is near a usable state
